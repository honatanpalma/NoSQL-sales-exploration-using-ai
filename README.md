# E-commerce Data Exploration with MongoDB Compass using Natural Language Query

This project explores an e-commerce sample Natural Language Query feature within Compass. By leveraging codeless analytics, we uncover valuable insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product trends without the need for complex queries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Online Retail Transaction Data" available on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/online-retail-transaction-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/online-retail-transaction-data). 

## Methodology

* The dataset was imported into MongoDB Atlas.
* A database and collection were created to store the data.
* MongoDB Compass's Natural Language Query feature was used to perform the analysis. This allows for querying the data using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for query syntax.

For more information on MongoDB Compass's Natural Language Query feature, see the official documentation: [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query-with-natural-language/prompt-natural-language-query/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query-with-natural-language/prompt-natural-language-query/)

## This project aims to answer the following business-critical questions:

### Market basket analysis for cross-selling opportunities
1. What are the top 3 product combinations (pairs or triplets) that are frequently purchased together?

## Insights and Findings 

The exploration of the dataset underscored the effectiveness of Natural Language Query feature in simplifying data analysis. By enabling interaction with the dataset through intuitive natural language prompts, the process of data exploration was significantly streamlined, benefiting both technical and non-technical users. 

Key observations:

* **Accelerated understanding of data:** The codeless approach enabled quicker comprehension of the dataset's structure and content.
* **Empowerment of non-technical users:** Business analysts and other stakeholders could independently extract insights without relying heavily on data engineers.
* **Seamless transition from exploration to production:** The ability to save views, build aggregation pipelines, and access the underlying queries facilitated the integration of findings into data engineering workflows. 
* **Enhanced collaboration:** The intuitive interface fostered collaboration between technical and non-technical teams, promoting data-driven decision-making across the organization

## Conclusion

Codeless analytics has demonstrated its transformative potential in the realm of data exploration and business intelligence. By leveraging tools like this, a wider range of users, regardless of their technical expertise, can actively participate in the discovery of insights. This fosters a more collaborative and data-driven decision-making environment, ultimately empowering organizations to harness the full potential of their data to drive innovation and growth.
